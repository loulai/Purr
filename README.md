This allows you to walk around stroking the keyboard of your laptop, and it'll purr.

How to run Purr
====
1. You'll need to clone into this repository. Do this by opening up your terminal, type this in and hit enter:
```
git clone git@github.com:loulai/Purr.git 
```

If successful, your terminal should display something like this (no need to type this in):
```
Cloning into 'Purr'...
remote: Counting objects: XX, done.
remote: Total XX (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

2. Now change into the directory you just cloned by typing this in your terminal and hitting enter:
```
cd Purr.rb
```

3. Now run it by typing this in your terminal and hitting enter:
```
ruby Purr.rb
```
